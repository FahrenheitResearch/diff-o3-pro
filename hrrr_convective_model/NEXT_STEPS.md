# Next Steps After Training Completes

## Immediate Actions (Tomorrow Morning)

### 1. Check Training Results
```bash
# View final training stats
./view_training_stats.sh

# Plot final loss curves
python plot_training_loss.py

# Check saved checkpoints
ls -la checkpoints/diffusion_fullres_final/
```

### 2. Run Initial Evaluation
```bash
# Run comprehensive evaluation
python evaluate_model.py

# This will:
# - Load best checkpoint
# - Generate 50-member ensembles for 20 test cases
# - Compute CRPS, spread, RMSE
# - Save visualizations
```

### 3. Generate Demo Forecasts
```bash
# Generate ensemble for current weather
python generate_realtime_forecast.py

# Create probability maps
python create_probability_products.py
```

## Key Questions to Answer

1. **Does it work?**
   - Are generated weather states physically plausible?
   - Does ensemble spread make sense?

2. **How good is it?**
   - CRPS compared to persistence/climatology
   - Spread-error relationships
   - Convection detection skill

3. **Should we scale up?**
   - If results are promising → train 5M+ parameter model
   - If not → diagnose issues first

## Scaling Decision Tree

```
IF evaluation shows:
  - CRPS < persistence forecast
  - Spread correlates with error
  - Realistic weather patterns
THEN:
  → Train 5M parameter model at full resolution
  → Extend to 3-6 hour lead times
  → Expand training data to 3+ months
ELSE IF results are marginal:
  → Try 50M model at 1/4 resolution
  → Investigate architecture improvements
  → Add attention mechanisms
ELSE:
  → Debug current approach
  → Check data quality
  → Verify implementation
```

## Production Pipeline Plan

Once we have a good model:

1. **Real-time Data Pipeline**
   - Automated HRRR download
   - Preprocessing pipeline
   - Ensemble generation every hour

2. **Products**
   - Probability of REFC > 35 dBZ
   - Convection initiation likelihood
   - Uncertainty-calibrated forecasts

3. **API Development**
   - REST endpoints for ensemble access
   - WebSocket for real-time updates
   - Integration with warning systems

## Research Outputs

1. **Technical Report**
   - Architecture details
   - Training methodology
   - Comprehensive evaluation

2. **Comparisons**
   - vs HRRR deterministic
   - vs HREF ensemble
   - vs persistence

3. **Case Studies**
   - Recent severe weather events
   - Challenging forecast scenarios
   - Success/failure analysis

## Timeline

- **Day 1** (Tomorrow): Initial evaluation
- **Day 2-3**: Comprehensive analysis
- **Day 4-5**: Decide on scaling
- **Week 2**: Begin scaled training if warranted
- **Week 3-4**: Production pipeline
- **Month 2**: Operational testing

Remember: This 81K model is just proving the concept works. The real value comes from scaling to larger models with this validated approach!

# Post-Training Plan for HRRR Convective Model

## Phase 1: Model Evaluation (Immediate)

### 1.1 Generate Ensemble Forecasts
- Load best checkpoint (lowest validation loss)
- Generate 50-100 member ensemble for multiple test cases
- Focus on convective scenarios (high CAPE/CIN, REFC > 20 dBZ)
- Save ensemble members for analysis

### 1.2 Uncertainty Quantification
- Calculate ensemble spread for each variable
- Verify spread correlates with forecast difficulty
- Compute spread-error relationships
- Compare uncertainty in convective vs non-convective regions

### 1.3 Sample Quality Assessment
- Visual inspection of generated weather states
- Check physical consistency (temperature/dewpoint relationships)
- Verify spatial coherence and realistic patterns
- Compare with actual HRRR forecasts

## Phase 2: Metrics & Validation

### 2.1 Probabilistic Metrics
- **CRPS (Continuous Ranked Probability Score)** - key metric for ensemble forecasts
- **Reliability diagrams** - are probabilities calibrated?
- **Rank histograms** - is ensemble spread appropriate?
- **Brier scores** for threshold exceedances (REFC > 35 dBZ)

### 2.2 Deterministic Metrics (ensemble mean)
- RMSE, MAE for each variable
- Spatial correlation
- Power spectrum analysis (are we preserving small scales?)
- FSS (Fractions Skill Score) for precipitation/reflectivity

### 2.3 Convection-Specific Evaluation
- POD/FAR for convective initiation
- Object-based verification for storm structures
- Timing errors for convective onset
- Ensemble probability of severe weather thresholds

## Phase 3: Scaling Strategy

### 3.1 Larger Model Training
Based on results, train larger models:
- **Option A**: 1-5M params at full resolution (proven feasible)
- **Option B**: 50M params at 1/4 resolution, then upsample
- **Option C**: Multi-scale approach (coarse + fine networks)

### 3.2 Longer Lead Times
- Current: 1-hour lead time
- Extend to: 3, 6, 12 hours
- May need recurrent or autoregressive approach

### 3.3 Data Expansion
- Current: 14 days training data
- Expand to: 3-12 months for seasonal coverage
- Include more extreme events

## Phase 4: Production Pipeline

### 4.1 Real-time System
```python
# Pseudo-code for operational pipeline
while True:
    # 1. Download latest HRRR analysis
    current_state = download_latest_hrrr()
    
    # 2. Generate ensemble forecast
    ensemble = generate_ensemble(
        model=trained_ddpm,
        initial_state=current_state,
        num_members=50,
        lead_hours=6
    )
    
    # 3. Post-process
    probabilities = calculate_exceedance_probs(ensemble)
    uncertainty = calculate_spread(ensemble)
    
    # 4. Visualize and serve
    create_probability_maps(probabilities)
    serve_to_api(ensemble, probabilities, uncertainty)
    
    sleep(3600)  # Run hourly
```

### 4.2 Visualization Products
- Ensemble mean and spread maps
- Probability of exceedance maps (REFC > 35 dBZ, CAPE > 2000)
- Spaghetti plots for specific contours
- Paintball plots showing all members
- Uncertainty-shaded deterministic forecasts

### 4.3 API/Interface
- REST API for ensemble access
- WebSocket for real-time updates
- Interactive web viewer
- Integration with existing weather services

## Phase 5: Scientific Analysis

### 5.1 Paper/Report Preparation
- Document architecture and training process
- Comprehensive evaluation results
- Comparison with operational ensembles (HREF, SREF)
- Case studies of high-impact events

### 5.2 Key Research Questions
1. **Does diffusion-based uncertainty correlate with forecast difficulty?**
2. **How does ensemble spread grow with lead time?**
3. **Are rare events better captured than deterministic models?**
4. **What's the optimal ensemble size for skill?**

### 5.3 Ablation Studies
- Impact of model size on ensemble quality
- Importance of each weather variable
- Effect of different noise schedules
- Benefit of longer training

## Phase 6: Towards Operations

### 6.1 Computational Optimization
- Model quantization (INT8/FP16)
- TensorRT optimization
- Batch ensemble generation
- Caching strategies

### 6.2 Robustness Testing
- Missing data handling
- Extreme weather cases
- Long-term stability
- Domain shifts (different seasons/regions)

### 6.3 User Feedback Integration
- Work with forecasters to refine products
- A/B testing of probability thresholds
- Iterative improvement based on verification

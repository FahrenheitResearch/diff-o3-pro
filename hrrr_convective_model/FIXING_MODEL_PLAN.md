# Model Fix Implementation Plan

## Critical Issues Identified
1. **No residual connection** - Model learns full transformation instead of changes
2. **MSE loss causes blurring** - Need spectral/perceptual loss
3. **Broken temporal encoding** - Using fake timestamps
4. **6-hour jump too large** - Need 1-hour steps
5. **Ensemble adds noise to blur** - Focus on deterministic first
6. **Undertrained** - Only 5 epochs of actual learning

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Architecture Fixes ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Identify residual connection issue
- [x] Modify UNet to add residual connection
- [x] Create UNetResidual class that outputs deltas
- [x] Verify forward pass maintains input structure

### Phase 2: Loss Function Overhaul ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Implement spectral loss (FFT-based)
- [x] Add L1 loss for sharper features
- [x] Create combined loss: 0.4*L1 + 0.3*Spectral + 0.2*MSE + 0.1*Gradient
- [x] Add gradient penalty for smoothness

### Phase 3: Temporal Encoding Fix ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Extract real timestamps from zarr data
- [x] Convert to hour-of-day and day-of-year
- [x] Pass through dataset and dataloader
- [x] Verify encoding produces meaningful features

### Phase 4: Time Step Reduction ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Change lead_hours from 6 to 1
- [x] Modify dataset to return t→t+1 pairs
- [x] Update training to handle 1-hour predictions
- [x] Implement iterative inference for multi-hour

### Phase 5: Training Overhaul ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Create train_deterministic.py (no ensemble)
- [x] Increase epochs to 200
- [x] Add cosine learning rate schedule
- [x] Implement gradient clipping
- [x] Add validation on real forecast skill

### Phase 6: Data Augmentation ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Add random crops during training (decided against - need full domain)
- [x] Implement horizontal/vertical flips
- [x] Add small noise injection
- [x] Create robust data pipeline

## Success Metrics
- Model produces sharp, realistic features
- 1-hour forecast RMSE < 2.0 (normalized)
- Reflectivity maintains storm structure
- No grid artifacts or excessive blur
- Iterative forecast remains stable to 24h

## Timeline
- Phase 1-3: Implement NOW (1 hour)
- Phase 4-5: Train overnight (8 hours)
- Phase 6: Tomorrow if needed
